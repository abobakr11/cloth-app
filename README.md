## Reflection

This is a 3 week long project following a course built in order to learn React's advanced features and familiarizing 
myself 
with React ecosystem.
I was planning to add many more features I had in mind, but I wasn't able to do so due to time constraints.
I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
